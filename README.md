This header file contains the pre-defined variables responsible for creating a deck of cards. Suits, Values, as well as the used string array cards.

<h2><b>Summary</b></h2>

```
1. Using pre-defined suit types and numbers the software fills each index of an array with the resulting string
2. Application then prompts user for how many cards they would like to Draw. 1-52, real number only. Will not accept other values.
3. Application then draws and displays the cards selected (shuffled or not).
```

This is a pre-cursor to blackjack and hopefully poker.
