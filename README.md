# Deck of Cards 

### Contained are the Following

>DeckofCards.cpp
>>This file calls upon Deck.h and uses this object/variable to define each individual card of the deck. (see code for commented details)
>
>Deck.h
>>This header file contains the pre-defined variables responsible for creating a deck of cards. Suits, Values, as well as the used string array cards.


The project does the following:

> 1. Using pre-defined suit types and numbers the software fills each index of an array with the resulting string
> 2. Application then prompts user for how many cards they would like to Draw. 1-52, real number only. Will not accept other values.
> 3. Application then draws and displays the cards selected (shuffled or not).


This is a pre-cursor to blackjack and hopefully poker.
